# Karel-Game

What is Karel?
Karel is a very simple robot living in a very simple world. By giving Karel a set of
commands, you can direct it to perform certain tasks within its world. The process of
specifying those commands is called programming. Initially, Karel understands only a
very small number of predefined commands, but an important part of the programming
process is teaching Karel new commands that extend its capabilities.


What's my code do?

Divide a given map into 4 equal chambers – take into consideration the special cases such as
small maps that can’t be divided into 4 chambers equally and divide them into the
maximum possible number of equal chambers (1, 2, or 3)
